## Detailed, simple and lightweight server status page
* * *
#### What is XStatus?
XStatus is a nice, small and detailed server status page. It shows things like CPU load,
memory usage, disk usage and so on in small and handy graphs. You can find the installation
instructions in the [XStatus wiki](https://github.com/NeoXiD/XStatus/wiki).

#### Version 2 (public-testing)
Version 2 is an experimental public beta. It may be vulnerable, contain bugs or other bad things. 
If anything like that occurs, please open an issue report. Basic configuration is possible in
the index.php file at the top. 

#### Upcoming features
- Real graphs
- Multi server support

#### System requirements
Any webserver with PHP support. This little handy script doesn't need any root access
or special commands. It will only parse unix commands and /proc/ files.
